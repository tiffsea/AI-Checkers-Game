# AI-Checkers-Game
This is an agile implementation of a Checkers board game with 2 opponents - a human and an AI. The AI is implemented using an adversarial search algorithm called Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning technique.

### Installation
Clone the repo using `git clone XXX` and open the program files from your Java IDE of choice. **Note** if you want to make changes to the code, you should fork this repo and proceed by working locally from your cloned-forked repo. Then edit any files from your IDE, save locally to your cloned repo, and commit changes back to your forked repo. Feel free to send me a pull request - I will review your changes and see if it makes sense adding to source repo.

### Useful Git Commands
- `git status` - shows the status of staged files
- `git branch` - shows which branch you're in currently (likely Master)
- `git checkout -b dev` - creates new branch called 'dev'
- `git switch dev` - switches from current branch to 'dev' branch
- `git add --all` - adds recently modified files from your local directory to your cloned directory
- `git commit --all -m "meaningful message goes here"` - commits all of your added changes to github repo (either forked or source depending on your case) with a customised message
